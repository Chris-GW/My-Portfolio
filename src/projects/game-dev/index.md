# My Game Dev Projects

I'm a full-stack software developer from Germany with a passion for making games in my free time. I use the Godot
Engine and have participated in several game jams, including solo and team-based ones.

## What I do in game projects

- ðŸŽ® Gameplay Programming (GDScript in Godot)
- ðŸ§  Game Design and System Logic
- ðŸ§ª Rapid Prototyping and Iteration
- ðŸ”§ Integrating assets, UI, and polish

## Experience

- 2x Solo Game Jam projects using Godot
- 2x Team collaboration in Game Jams (Mini Jam, GMTK, etc.)
- Years of professional software development in web applications

Always happy to connect, learn, and build cool stuff with others during game jams.
